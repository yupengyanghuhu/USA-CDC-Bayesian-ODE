    County-level SEIR model forecasts of incident (weekly) cases number by fitting predicted cases to the observations.

data_inputs: NYTimes time-series cases and deaths data

methods_long: >-
    We break down the SEIR model into 7 compartments: 
    &#8226; Susceptible individuals (S), 
    &#8226; Exposed individuals (E), 
    &#8226; Contagious individuals who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (C), 
    &#8226; Infected with moderate or non-severe symptoms (I_N), 
    &#8226; Infected with severe symptoms (I_S), 
    &#8226; Recovered (R) 
    &#8226; Deaths (D). 
    
    We fit our model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method in each county to estimate 
    the parameters set (alpha, beta, mu, h, gamma, theta, delta...). We start with the initial parameters set 
    from other studies and iterate the set in the model by calculating and comparing the likelihood values between 
    the real cases and projected cases, finally we get our best projected curve (with 95% confidence interval) which 
    has minimum sum of squared residuals (SSR).
